This is a professional portfolio that has responsive design and active links

This website mainly uses flexbox to create a responsive design
For the main content of the website there is a collumn flexbox and that collumn has 3 row flexbox's inside the collumn
each row flexbox has a sectiontitle and a sectioncontent
I created a mockup of all the html and added the css of the general idea:

I then just needed to make eveything look nicer and get padding and margins right
